# Helpful Jekyll Resources
The following is a list of help resources that I often refer to when working with Jekyll.

## Sites
- [The Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
- [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) (The docs for the template I use on my blog)
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/jonschlinkert/5854601)
- [Another Markdown Cheatsheet](http://nestacms.com/docs/creating-content/markdown-cheat-sheet)
- [Fix GitHub Metadata and SSL Errors](https://www.hieule.info/programming/fix-errors-github-metadata-ssl-certificate-running-jekyll-serve/)
- [Let Jekyll Watch on Windows](https://labs.sverrirs.com/jekyll//5-wdm-gem.html) (This is so you can do a "Jekyll serve --watch" on Windows that works)

## IDE
My IDE of choice for working on my blog is [Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com/). 
It's a great little code editor much like [Atom](https://atom.io) that had a ton of plugins and works across multiple 
platforms (there are even "un-official" ports to Chromebook and ReaspberryPi for all you hip kids at [https://code.headmelted.com/](https://code.headmelted.com/)) with support for many 
popular file formats.
