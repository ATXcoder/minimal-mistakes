title: Post A Day

One of the goals of re-starting my blog (yup..."re-starting" as in I've shared my useless wisdom with the unwanting
masses before) is that I make at least one post a day. Of course I feel it only fair to mention at this point that
me actually posting to this blog everyday is a "best case scenario", but none the less it is one that I am going to strive
for.

For those not caring about the post of the day and are only here for my insightful, witty, and thought provoking commentary
and articles then I offer you the following tag: "Post Of The Day". Add this cleverly named tag to your ignore list and never
worry about accidentally wondering into these types of post again.
